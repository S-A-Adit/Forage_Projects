Simulate games under extreme weather conditions (snow, rain, wind)

Overview:

The College Football Game is played under various existing conditions. Organizing college football games under extreme conditions presents unique challenges that can significantly enhance participants' skill levels.

Value Statement:

Adding such extreme conditions will add increasingly challenging environment for players to engage in. By playing in these conditions they will gain extra experience points compared to regular environments and boost their ranking 

Solution:

Games played under extreme environments would operate differently. The player would have to specifically pick extreme games and he would be matched with another player looking for the same conditions. The extreme environment would be assigned randomly from Extreme Heat and Humidity, Strong Winds, Heavy Rain and Snow. The risk of participating in such conditions is high for players so games in these conditions will be held for 60 mins instead of 90. The team winning with a difference of 2 or more will gain more rewards on top of the extra experience points and rank boost.

Evaluation Statement:

This game will enhance the difficulty of the game immensely motivating pro players to further improve their rank and compete with other pro players engaging in an increased challenging gameplay further supported by the 60 minute format and the extreme weather condition. he addition of a color-blind mode, easily enabled from the main menu, ensures that this heightened challenge is inclusive and reachable for all players. Importantly, this new minigame integrates seamlessly without requiring any new mechanics or functionality, maintaining a streamlined experience while broadening its appeal.
